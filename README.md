# util-bot-v4
Open sourced version of the Typical Developers' utilities bot. This is primarily for if anyone is interested in looking at the code, so documentation is basically non-existent. This also doubles as a way to give me feedback, so if you have any, please let me know by making an issue or pr documenting changes that could be made.
> **Note**  
> Not all of the code is included in this version of the bot, as it is too sensitive to disclose.
> Any future updates to the bot will also not be included until updated, since this is not the main branch of the bot.

## License
All code for the bot is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/typical-developers/util-bot-v4/blob/main/LICENSE) license. Please check the license file for more detailed information.
> **Note**  
> In a nutshell, this means you are free to do whatever with the code, as long as you let others do the same.
